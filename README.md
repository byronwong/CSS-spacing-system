# Grid Spacing System

## Background 
I was initially looking for a vertical grid system, but after much searching I realised there were a lot of limitations. Some solutions tried to calculate the cap height, and through trial and error you would eventually align with the baseline grid. 

This was all good, I was up for bit of pain in figuring out the cap height and then I am set, or am I?
Introducting images throws everything out the window, especially when they are responsive. 

The current solution is to park a vertical grid system for now and focus on consistant spacing (which I think is important). 

So here's a system that will give you consistant spacing and watch this space for a vertical grid...

## Setup
Currently in SASS, will introduce LESS version soon.
Just include in with your SASS files.
